###3D printed parts notes###

BatteryHolder: appearance does not matter, as long as battery fits with a little room.

BearingSupport: ball cannot come out when you shake, but should roll freely and have a tiny bit of movement. We use adaptive layer height to cleanup the inside sphere roughness from layer lines.

Buttons: must be .2mm layer height (based on design), no support needed. The top 4 layers for the symbols are in white. 
The robot has 7 buttons: 2x straight arrows (purple, yellow), 2x turn arrows (1 mirrored in slicer, left-blue and right-orange), 1x play (green), 1x menu (grey), 1x stop (red)

SnapWheel: adaptive layer height (not sure this matters), first layer at octogram spiral since this will be seen, no supports needed

ChargerMountingStand: 25% infill or greater for charger needs to be sturdier-  .2mm layer height
